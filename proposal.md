#### NewCo. (Name in progress! I want it to be cool, not rushed.)

#### Description

NewCo. is a social networking platform that will allow users to sign-up, add friends, and post different types of content such as images and comments in an effort to innovate the next generation of online socializing. 

##### Use Case

The growing complexity that comes from taking a full-on social experience and embedding it onto an online platform is ever-changing and has not reached its fullest potential. Therefore, primary users will consist of younger folk who seek to connect with friends and family while being able to smoothly navigate through navbars, buttons, and hyperlinks. 

As technology continues to become an integral part of daily life, more and more people will create an account on some popular social media platform. Many are cluttered with links, buttons, and information in an unorganized manner. 

##### Minimum Viable Product

* Feature that allows a user to post and delete a message on a newsfeed.
* Feature that allows a user to comment on other peopleâ€™s posts.
* Feature that allows a user to to 'like' or 'dislike' someone else's comment.


##### Tools for MVP

* Firebase && Firestore - This will be used for user authentication, realtime database, and eventually hosting. By utilizing this BaaS, it will decrease start-up development time, and handle traffic until the platform expands. 

* React && Redux - These librarries will be used as the front-end framework, focusing on the user experience by providing a fast and reactive application as possible.

* Express && Node.js - This will be used to create a REST API server.

* Material-UI - This library will be used to style the app such as the navbar, buttons, and other features.

##### Additional Features

* User Registration / Sign-Up Feature - A user's account log-in information will be held in database storage.

* Log-in / Log-out Feature - A user will be able to log in and out of their account using database authentication.

* Notifications - A user will be notified when someone interacts with their posts.

* Sort Newsfeed in Ascending Timestamp Order - The most recent posts will show on the newsfeed.

* Videos / Images - A user will be able to post an image or a video.

* Share - A user will be able to share someone else's post.

##### Tools for Additional Features

* Postman

* RESTful API

* Bootsrap


##### Additional Information
	The main focus with this application will be on the UI and UX. The goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing, easy and intuitive interactive website that will attempt to compel users to sign up and make this app a household name. It would be too much to tackle every single feature that popular platforms already offer, so the biggest difference will lie in interaction.
