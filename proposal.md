#### NewCo. (Name in progress! I want it to be cool, not rushed.)

#### Description

NewCo. is a social networking platform that will allow users to sign-up, add friends, and post different types of content such as images and comments in an effort to innovate the next generation of online socializing. 

##### Use Case

The growing complexity that comes from taking a full-on social experience and embedding it onto an online platform is ever-changing and has not reached its fullest potential. Therefore, primary users will consist of younger folk who seek to connect with friends and family while being able to smoothly navigate through navbars, buttons, and hyperlinks. 

As technology continues to become an integral part of daily life, more and more people will create an account on some popular social media platform. Many are cluttered with links, buttons, and information in an unorganized manner.

##### Additional Information
	My main focus with this project will be on UI and UX. I want to create an aesthetically pleasing, easy and intuitive interactive website that will attempt to compel users to sign up and make this app a household app. It would be too much to tackle every single feature that popular platforms already offer, so my main difference will lie in interaction. However, I do hope to hit MVP throughout the weekend so I can balance time on some additional features and not get too carried away just on UI/UX.
